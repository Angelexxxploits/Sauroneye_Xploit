My first virus I made. Will mess with the computer if you click on it. I use it with Metasploit. It's most for fun and almost completely harmless, however if you use it on your own computer, make sure to have the off-switch at the ready so you can turn it of if it gets overheated. You may lose control of your computer, and the virus will do the following: Make the keyboard blink in different colours, print a virus text wherever you try to type and start different programs. If used with metasploit, this virus can be placed inside the system manager, so it activates automatically every time your victim starts his computer, which will render the computer unusable.
